## OpenAI API 1.0 Update

_Due to the massive update OpenAI brought in their November 2023 Dev Day, we have deprecated most of the former functionality now as OpenAI has dedicated UI on their own platform to work with [fine-tuning](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning) and better token [usage tracking](https://platform.openai.com/usage) across the entire organization, two of the key features of OpenAI-Tools formerly._

_You can still check out the old code in the_ `Pre-1.0 branch`.

## Speech

The completely revamped app is now focusing on both speech recognition (Whisper) and and generation (TTS).
